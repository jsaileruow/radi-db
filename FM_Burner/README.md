## Introduction
<XXXX A bit more infoXXX>

## Important

As stated before, the calculations with `FDS` need an installation of at least this version 
 `FDS-6.8.0-138-g51097e3-nightly`.
 
 Similar for `OpenFOAM`, the approach is adjusted for `OpenFOAM-v2212`. Other versions should be possible as well; some minor adjustments of the so called `functionObjects` are probably needed (this is not tested in detail).

## Experimental data

The main directory for the FM-Burner is in the `macfp-db` project:
https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/tree/master/Extinction/FM_Burner

There, the experimental setup for the `FM-Burner` is described in detail: 
https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/tree/master/Extinction/FM_Burner/Documentation


And e.g. available experimental data is located at:

## Directory Structure
<XXXX A bit more infoXXX>

The selection is generated by first running a fully coupled FDS simulation with a time step of $\Delta t=0.001$ for $200\,\mathrm{s}$, where all available fields are saved each second, such that one gets a collection of fields each second and $200$ collections overall. One such collection of fields, saved at one distinct time is called a snapshot. 
Because band resolved radiation calculation (with line by line (LBL) photon Monte Carlo (PMC)) is an expensive task, a more or less random selection of $40$ snapshots is taken from the original $200$ ones. The selection is considered to be representative with respect to mean value and extreme events.
The selection process is summarized in the following graph: 

```mermaid 
flowchart LR
subgraph " "
  a("FDS
  (fully coupled)") -- "run simulation for 200 s" --> b("200 snapshots") -- "select representative set" --> c("40 snapshots")
end 
```

The procedure that is documented in this git is shown in the diagram below.
```mermaid 
flowchart TD
subgraph " "
  a("40 snapshots") -- " " --> b("LBL-PMC (calculated solution is part of the repository)") -- " " --> f("comparison")
  a("40 snapshots") -- "` `" --> c("fireRADFoam_MaCFP (radiation only)") -- " " --> f("comparison")
  a("40 snapshots") -- "` `" --> d("FDS (radiation only)") -- " " --> f("comparison")
  a("40 snapshots") -- "` `" --> e("your custom solver/configuration") -- " " --> f("comparison") -- " " --> g("postprocessing")
end 
```
